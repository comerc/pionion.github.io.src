## ION
---
#### ION is a distributed real-time communication system, let people communicate anydevice, anytime, anywhere!üåç 


## Architecture
---
![arch](https://github.com/pionion/pionion.github.io.src/raw/master/resources/logo/arch.png)

## Modules
* BIZ --- a distributed signal server
* ISLB ---a distributed load-balance|service-discovery server
* SFU ---a distributed media stream server
* AVP ---a distributed audio|video process server
## How to work
* All modules connected to nats, exchange signals to each other through message queue
* Clients connected to BIZ, exchange [SDP](https://webrtchacks.com/sdp-anatomy) or other signals with BIZ
* BIZ will get an [SFU](https://webrtcglossary.com/sfu/) node from ISLB, exchange SDP with SFU
* Clients finally exchanged their SDP, They start [ICE](https://webrtcglossary.com/ice) now
* Clients see videos from each other when ICE finish
