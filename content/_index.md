## 📖Architecture
---
![arch](https://github.com/pionion/pionion.github.io.src/raw/master/resources/logo/arch.png)

## 🌟Featurs
---
  - [x] Real Destributed RTC Architecture with microservices
  - [x] Modern, full-platforms SDKs/APPs: Flutter, JS, GO, Swift etc.
  - [x] High performance, continuous optimization
  - [x] Full webrtc stacks: NACK/PLI/TWCC/REMB/RR/SR/Simulcast
  - [x] Advandced features: Speaker-Detection, Simulcast, Selective-Subcription
## 🖥️Playground
Try this [playground]("TODO"). Build a conference room with little code

## ☕️Why ION?
RTC Public PAAS/SAAS are expensive and limited flexibility, like: Twilio/Agora/Zoom

Real Destributed RTC System is not easy. Many Public PAAS/SAAS based on destributed architecture with microservices. This is not a simple cluster architecture.

ION make all things easy, from front-end to back-end, will support all platforms, all scene, all protocol


Tips:
You can learn go/webrtc/flutter/.. first if you are a newbie of RTC, see [faq](./faq)
